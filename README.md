# Thesis_Data_Analysis
Thesis_Data_Analysis is the method I used to perform my research analysis.
It uses multiple aspects of Python and is a object oriented method.

## Installation
The user can use it when it has relevant netCDF files generated by PCR-GLOBWB (http://www.globalhydrology.nl/models/pcr-globwb-2-0/).
Other netCDF files are also possible to use, because it first writes the data to csv-files. 
  Then those are loaded again into the system and are used to analyse.
The code should be activated by 'runner.py'.

## Link to Thesis:
The link to the thesis that shows the findings of this method will be published as soon as possible.

### Requirements for this application:
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Cycler
- Seaborn
- NETCDF4
- Hydrostats
